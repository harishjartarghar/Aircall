# Aircall - Harish_A_Jartarghar

## Features

- Two tabs to switch between normal calls and archived calls
- Normal Calls shows calls which are not archived and vice versa for archive tab.
- Clicking on the call logs, opens expanded view and archive button is present.
- Archive all button, archives all calls possible.
- unArchive All button, resets to the previous approach.


## Impmentation

- Have used Provider/Consumer approach for API call handling, which is brain for handling business logics.
- Have used module scss for each component. Avoided any UI library by using in house styling.
- Have used eslint for better code linting.
- Have made webpack and babelrc changes based on need.
- Have broken down the component into atoms, molecules and organisms.
